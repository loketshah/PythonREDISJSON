 When you enter this home you will be pleasantly surprised at how light and bright it is, with a beautiful brand new kitchen featuring granite countertops, custom chosen cabinetry, all new appliances (includes a stove/oven, refrigerator, dishwasher and a microwave) and beautifully selected large slab tile flooring. The living area is very spacious.  On the main level there are 2 bedrooms with a fully updated bathroom featuring a custom tiled tub/shower, a new vanity, new fixtures and lighting.  Walking down to the finished basement, you will be pleasantly surprised at how roomy it is, featuring 3 bedrooms (one is non-conforming - this would be great for an office/work out room/extra storage). The walk-out basement would be great for a rental apartment (could possibly build in a small kitchen) because there is a separate entrance. The entire home has brand new carpet, beautiful new tile and fresh paint, along with new windows throughout. The furnace is new, as well.  The lot is large - perfect for pets, a garden and/or entertaining. The area has easy access to public transportation, shopping and highway access.  Buyer and/or Buyer's agent to verify all information.","REC_RVSpaces":"0","REC_ReservedSpaces":"0","REC_RestrictionsCovenants":"Other","REC_RestrictionsCovenantsYN":"1","Roof":["Composition"],"REC_RoomCount":"7","SeniorCommunityYN":false,"Sewer":["Public

This unique opportunity in unincorporated Boulder county could be your home!  In summer months, host guests (lots of parking space) on the large deck and patio area, play in the in-ground pool, serve snacks from the pool house and relax in the hot tub room after your swim.  Or maybe you have horses...this property is zoned for 2 horses and the building currently used as a workshop could be a tack room.  Or maybe you'd like to utilize the workshop as is...so many choices to customize the way YOU live!  During the rest of the year, entertain in this updated one level home...your open great room, updated kitchen and enclosed back family room will encourage your guest/family gatherings to enjoy themselves.  You'll appreciate the kitchen's quartz counters, gas stove, the peninsula for food prep or casual dining.  The owner's suite has a walk-in closet, it's own stackable laundry and a spa-like bath.  A second laundry room is available in the basement mechanical room.  Want to work from home?  You'll have options there, too - work on the main level or utilize one of the bonus areas in the basement for your office(s) space.  Top all this off with a new boiler and some fresh paint and call this one home!  Owners in the neighborhood are stake holders in the water company that serves the neighborhood.   All information is deemed reliable - buyer and buyer's broker must verify.  Possession 72 hours following delivery of deed.  Showings begin 10/7 at 10 a.m. at open house.

incomparable Cory-Merrill neighborhood! This beautifully remodeled home embodies the quintessential modern living space, with updates like new flooring, paint, textures, roofing, and carpeting. In the relaxing eat-in kitchen, you’ll find a brand-new quartz peninsula, elegant backsplash, brand new cabinets, and newly installed state-of-the-art appliances. The main floor features 2 large bedrooms and 1 spacious remodeled bathroom. \r\n\r\nThe living room connects smoothly into the kitchen, providing a sense of openness that makes the space feel truly grand. Enjoy a cup of coffee or a glass of wine curled up next to the fireplace. Downstairs, the finished basement offers an additional bathroom (also remodeled) and a family room, perfect for hanging out, playing games, or watching movies. All the main appliance fixtures of the home are brand new as well, including the AC unit, electrical panel, furnace, and water heater.\r\nWhen you step outside, catch some shade under the freshly built pergola—or why not have a barbeque? The eye-catching exterior of this home also features the following upgrades: new siding, roof, fence, and windows. \r\nNow this will really knock your socks off: The home boasts a “mother-in-law suite” guest house with its own partial kitchen and bathroom, which opens up a world of possibilities…including additional income! Either rent out this space—again, in one of the most desirable local neighborhoods—on Airbnb for some extra cash, or show your friends, family, and guests the true meaning of comfort in this private addition.\r\nLast but not least, this home features a 4-car garage! Honestly, for a home like this, you can’t beat this price. Located mere minutes from popular Washington Park, Cherry Creek, Bonnie Brae, and DU, this peaceful escape is the best of both worlds!

All new plumbing fixtures and valves, electric switches, outlets, light fixtures and electric service box. All new kitchen cabinets, vanities, millwork, doors, hardware, quartz countertops, appliances (including refrigerator, oven/range, range hood, dishwasher, microwave, washer and dryer). All new bathrooms with custom glass doors, LVP throughout the first floor and carpet in lower level. This home includes an irrigation system, leaf-guard gutters, transferable warranty remaining on the windows. The garage has new epoxy flooring and fresh paint, a car enthusiast's envy! All new interior and exterior paint and new landscaping. The home flows very beautifully into a first floor primary bedroom with a bright walk-in closet with an all new closet system and a large en suite with a private toilet area. The other first floor bedroom has a full private bathroom and there is a first floor guest powder room as well. The centerpiece of the kitchen is a large island that serves as a dining table or entertainment space. You enter the front door into a spacious open floor plan home. The cable system handrail creates an interesting modern look and maintains the open feel of the home. Downstairs there are 3 other conforming bedrooms all complete with illuminating egress windows. The tiled laundry room has ample space to work with new cabinets and utility sink. The lower level also has a large tandem bathroom that has a private powder room adjacent to the shower side. The lower level rec room provides more space for relaxing or entertaining. There is also a fully finished large storage room. We were thoughtful about every detail of this home. We hope you appreciate all of the attention to detail that went into this renovation.

The laundry room on the main floor was initially a bedroom but converted for convenience. \r\nThe basement can be an apartment, (Buyer to check with city/county regarding zoning) as there is a full kitchen down there. There's a lot of room in that basement with all new carpet/vinyl and paint. It looks good!\r\nThe roof is 9 years old. \r\nAs you'll see, the yard is lovely and has been well maintained. You'll find a very comfortably sized patio in the back, and a spacious yard. Walkway to an enviable 2 car, oversized garage. The alley is paved. \r\nIt's located 2 blocks from the very popular Cherry Cricket restaurant; about a mile to downtown Littleton - easy walk or bike ride. Littleton hosts an awesome Christmas atmosphere, year round dining, and a great \"small town\" feel; a popular destination for a lot of folks! There are parks easily within walking distance and light rail is in downtown Littleton.

quiet cul-de-sac in East Boulder. Generous room sizes, soaring vaulted ceilings, beautiful hardwood floors, a charming screened-in porch and many recent updates including brand new carpet on the main and upper levels (October 2023), new water heater (May 2023), new stainless kitchen appliances (2021), new mini split AC/heat pump system (2020) and a new Class Four roof that is scheduled for late October. The open plan design includes bright and airy living and dining rooms that connect seamlessly to the kitchen where granite counters, newer stainless appliances, plenty of cabinets and a pantry will please any gourmet chef. Ideal for entertaining, the kitchen is open to a casual dining area framed by a wall of windows and to the family room where you can enjoy a good book or movie next to the cozy gas fireplace with stone facade. A charming screened porch overlooking the fenced backyard is the perfect place to enjoy your morning coffee. A guest bedroom or home office and a 3/4 bath complete the main level. Upstairs, you'll find a spacious primary suite with vaulted ceiling, walk-in closet and nicely updated 5 piece en-suite bath. Two more bedrooms and an updated full bath complete this level. The finished basement with daylight, above grade windows includes a large rec room with plenty of flexible space for your TV, games, hobbies and workout gear. Also on this level is another large bedroom or office and an unfinished space that would accommodate a workshop & ample storage. The 3 car attached garage provides plenty of room for all of your outdoor gear too. Stroll to well regarded elementary schools, Ozo Coffee, Pica's or BlackBelly, as well as bike paths through the neighborhood that connect to the Boulder Creek path towards downtown and to the Foothills. Also close by is the Rock Park playground, Flatirons Golf Course and the Bobolink Trail.","REC_RealEstateIncludedYN":"0","REC_RestrictionsCovenantsYN":"0","Roof":["Composition"],"REC_RoomCount":"15","SecurityFeatures":["Smoke Detector(s)"],"Sewer":["Public

One of the best homes in Swansea!  This immaculate 4 bed / 2 bath home is only 5 minutes from downtown Denver & 20 minutes to the edge of the mountains!  Check it out: New roof, new carpet, new electrical subpanel in garage, newer furnace, newer central air conditioning, newer stainless kitchen appliances, washer & dryer included, huge-fenced yard (double lot), oversized 2 car garage, 3 off street parking in alley, 1 off street parking in front and a covered front porch.  The only thing this home needs is a fresh green lawn.  Everything else is already done.  If you don't desire a yard but would rather have car/trailer/boat/RV storage all you need to do is install a big gate in the fence to store all of your vehicles securely behind the fence.  Tough market? Check out down payment assistance programs to make it just a bit easier to qualify.

Hill Tutor seamlessly mixes modern updates with 1920's charm! Cleverly designed for entertaining and comfortable living. With over 1,500 square feet on the main floor, the size of this ranch style home at this price point is unheard of in Park Hill. The bright and open living room features an arch top entry door, wood burning fireplace and a bay window. A large arched passthrough with breakfast bar allows you to prepare meals without being excluded from living room activities. The kitchen is a chef's dream with a generous number of cabinets and granite countertop space, high-end stainless appliances, a bay window breakfast nook, recessed lighting, and a new tile floor. A second passthrough from the kitchen opens to a dining room which features a 2nd fireplace and a picture window. Among other uses, this room could be used as a library, second living area, media room or office area. The spacious primary bedroom is a rare find in this neighborhood; complete with a walk-in closet, full bath, sitting/dressing area, recessed lighting, and several exposed brick areas - this space will relax you at night and energize you in the morning! A 2nd bedroom and another full bath on the main floor reinforce this amazing floor plan. The 800+ sq ft basement is ready for you to finish if you need additional space or offers tons of storage. This sought after location is minutes away from outdoor activities and cultural events at City Park, the Museum of Nature and Science, IMAX Theatre, Denver Zoo, and City Park Golf Course. Shopping, eating and playing are available 5 blocks away at Fairfax Park and Shops, or less than 10 minutes to Sprouts, Walmart, & many restaurants and shopping options at Central Park and Lowry. This home has a newer roof, the electrical system has been gone through, & baseboard heater system has been serviced. A little tlc, mainly minor stucco repair, exterior paint, & refinishing the hardwoods would turn this amazing home into a stunning masterpiece!","REC_RVSpaces":"0","REC_ReservedSpaces":"0","REC_RestrictionsCovenantsYN":"0","RoadFrontageType":["Public"],"RoadResponsibility":["Public Maintained

Nearly new home! Built in 2020, with luxurious fixtures, finishes, outpouring of natural light and guaranteed views for miles as this 1.25 acre home backs to non-buildable open space wetlands, so you'll never have a rear neighbor! Also enjoy bringing your chickens and small 4h farm animals, country livin at its finest! This home has been meticulously cared for and improved upon, with improved insulation, electrical availability, and CAT6 wired throughout the home. Walking around the grounds you'll be mesmerized by gorgeous rose bushes, dozens of evergreens, and fruiting peach, apple and cherry trees. Electrical conduit's already been brought back from the home for your future 1500 SF polebarn/workshop, or up to 10,000SF pond! All the hard work has already been done, such as pronounced negative grading around the home to ensure a bone-dry basement & front and rear landscaping and patios, so you can move right in and add your personal touches to the established raised-bed pads and unfinished basement.  Inside you'll love the elegant hardwood flooring and tall ceilings, filled with natural light from skylights and windows, adorned with iron railings and natural stone facades. The luxurious chef's kitchen is the focal point of the home, with inspiring granite slab island and counters, soft-close cabinetry, and designer lighting. This is a rare find, with the perfect balance of spacious country living with convenient shopping and dining options in Windsor/Timnath 10 minutes away, or Greeley/Fort Collins just a few minutes more.
